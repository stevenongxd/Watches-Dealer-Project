# Watches-Dealer-Project
The WatchesDealer Project is a group project assigned for the Business Application Development Laboratory course in the third semester of the Information System program at Bina Nusantara University, intended for B25 students. This project involves utilizing Java Fundamentals, Java OOP, JavaFX, and XAMPP MySQL (PHPMyAdmin) database.

The WatchesDealer Shop program has been designed with both customer and admin perspectives in mind. Customers can browse and purchase watches, and also view their transaction history. 
Admins, on the other hand, have the ability to manage the products and brands offered on the website, including adding, updating, or removing them as needed.
